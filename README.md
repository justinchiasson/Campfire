# Welcome to Campfire!
Campfire is an in-development social media application for rating, reviewing, and sharing music with the community.

All design and development is currently being done by Justin Chiasson, a Vancouver-based software developer working at SAP Canada.

### Stack

-	The front end is being developed in JavaScript using React Native â€“ it currently allows for browsing for songs pulled from the Apple Music API catalog, authentication using AWS Amplify, and viewing artist, album, and song information in a visually stunning UI.
-	The back end consists of a Node.js Express server, using GraphQL API calls to connect the client app to a PostgreSQL database.
